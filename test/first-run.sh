# What happens on a machine that has never set a weather location.
#
# The unit tests cover the pure half — an absent file reads as "unset", a name
# with no coordinates reads as "unresolved" — and pass whatever the shell does
# with those answers. This runs the real `Service.qml` under Quickshell against
# a home directory that does not exist yet, and checks the wiring.
#
# The interesting part is a gap the code can only assert in a comment. The
# location file is watched, but a watch reaches no further than the directory
# holding it, and on a fresh machine `~/.local/state/omarchy/settings/` has
# never been created — so the first location ever written is invisible to the
# watch that exists to notice it. What closes the gap is the panel calling
# `reloadLocation()` after a successful save. Nothing else would ever fire, and
# nothing but this notices if that call is removed.
#
# Offline by construction: `curl` and `omarchy-weather-location` are replaced on
# PATH. A test that reached Open-Meteo would be flaky in CI and would put this
# plugin's continuous integration on someone else's free service.
#
# Needs `qs` (Quickshell), which is why CI runs this job in an Arch container
# rather than on ubuntu-latest. Skips where there is no `qs`, so the suite still
# runs on a machine without it; AERORADAR_REQUIRE_QS turns that skip into a
# failure, which is what CI sets.
