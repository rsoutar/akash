# What decoding the ground costs the thread that draws the shell.
#
# The unit tests prove that decoding in steps yields the same basemap as
# decoding at once. This runs the real `Service.qml` under Quickshell and
# watches the thread while it decodes the shipped file: a timer asking to run
# every 16 ms records the longest gap between two of its ticks, which is the
# longest the bar, the panels and the lock screen would all have stood still.
#
# Read in one call, the file held that thread for over half a second on a
# fast laptop. The bound below is loose, because a runner is slower and
# noisier than a laptop, and it is still five times under that.
#
# It also checks that the layers arrive one at a time and in order, that the
# result is complete, and that nothing about it reads as a failure.
#
# Offline by construction, like test/first-run.sh: `curl` and
# `omarchy-weather-location` are replaced on PATH, so the service's own
# polling finds nothing to talk to — and the probe asks only for the basemap,
# never for a manifest, so nothing else is started. Needs `qs`; skips without
# it, and AERORADAR_REQUIRE_QS turns the skip into a failure, which is what
# CI sets.
