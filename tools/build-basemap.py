"""Build data/basemap.bin from Natural Earth.

The plugin draws its own basemap instead of fetching raster tiles. The world's
coastlines do not change, so shipping them costs a few megabytes once instead
of a request per tile forever — and, more to the point, it cannot be taken
away: a keyless tile endpoint is a policy, not a property, and the one this
plugin used started stamping "API KEY REQUIRED" across every tile in August
2026, on a Wednesday, for every installation at once.

Raster tiles could not be shipped: the world from z0 to z9 is 349,525 tiles,
several gigabytes. Vector geometry for the same area is under three megabytes,
because a coastline is a list of points rather than a picture of one.

Run by hand when the source data or the layer selection changes; the output is
committed. Sources are cached in tools/.cache, which is not.

    python3 tools/build-basemap.py

Natural Earth is public domain. Credit is given in the panel anyway.

Format
------

Everything is little more than LEB128 varints. Coordinates are quantised to
integers (see QUANTUM) and stored as zigzag deltas from the previous point of
the same ring. Strings are a byte length followed by UTF-8.

    magic       "OWRB"
    version     u8, FORMAT_VERSION
    quantum     varint
    layers      varint, then that many layers:

    layer       name string, kind u8, min zoom u8, max zoom u8, feature count varint
      geometry  ring total varint, point total varint, then per feature:
                  ring count varint, then per ring:
                    point count varint, then per point: delta x signed, delta y signed
      places    per place: delta x signed, delta y signed, min zoom u8, name string

The ring and point totals let the decoder allocate every array once and read
the layer in a single pass; the alternative is a counting pass over the same
bytes, which under the QML engine cost a third of the decode. They are checked
against the bytes that follow — a header that does not match its layer is a
corrupt file, not a hint.
