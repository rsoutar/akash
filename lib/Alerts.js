// Three of these sit on the published scale. The lowest deliberately does not.
// Open-Meteo reports precipitation rounded to a tenth of a millimetre per slot,
// so the smallest rain it can express is 0.1 mm in a quarter of an hour — 0.4
// mm/h — and the scale's drizzle boundary of 0.5 mm/h falls in the gap above
// it. A band there is above every reading the source can produce at the bottom
// of its range: of 1728 slots sampled across eighteen convective regions, 446
// were wet and 265 of those were exactly one step, so 59% of the rain the
// source reported was being classified as no rain at all. 0.3 is below one
// step and above zero, which makes the lowest band mean "the source reported
