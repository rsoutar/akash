// Reads RainViewer's coverage mask to answer one question: does a ground
// radar reach the configured location?
//
// Large parts of the world have none, and an empty map there reads as a
// broken plugin unless it says so. The mask is transparent where coverage
// exists, so the answer is one pixel — but getting at a pixel means drawing
// the image, which is why this is a Canvas rather than a plain Image.

  // The one network stream this plugin does not bound the decode of, and the
  // only way to read the mask that works. Context2D reads pixels from an
  // image it loaded itself; handed an Image item instead — which would carry
  // a `sourceSize` — drawImage produces nothing to read, and every location
  // comes back reported as covered. Measured, against five places on and off
  // the radar network.
  //
  // What bounds it instead: the URL is built from the manifest's host, which
  // parseManifest requires to be an https origin, and the manifest itself
  // arrives over TLS from RainViewer. See the stream-inventory test for the
  // record of this exception.
  //
  // Driven explicitly rather than by the load signal alone. A probe begun
  // against a closed panel queues a repaint that never arrives, and an image
  // already in Qt's cache does not re-emit imageLoaded to restart one.
